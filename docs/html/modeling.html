            <p>These instructions apply to all of the modeling queries <b>EXCEPT convolutional_query()</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ONLY the instruction parameter is required for the queries.</li>
                    <li><b>When providing your instruction make sure that you're describing a column. For example: if you want the dataset to use a column named median_house_value as the target, make your instruction "please estimate the median house value". If you want your target to be number_of_households, make your instruction "In Baltimore, model the number of households". </b> </li>
                    <li>You can also just pass the column name in as the instruction</li>
                    <li>ALL tabular datasets will work with this query. The more parameters you specify, the more optimized your model will be.</li>
